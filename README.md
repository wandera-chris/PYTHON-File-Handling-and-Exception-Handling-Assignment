# FUNCTION EXPLANATION

Flexibility with modification_function:
The modify_and_write_file function now takes a modification_function as an argument. This allows you to apply any desired modification to the file's contents without changing the core file reading/writing logic.
The example shows how to create two different modification functions: uppercase_modification and add_line_numbers.
Clearer Error Handling:
The try...except block now catches FileNotFoundError specifically, providing a more informative error message.
Also catches general exceptions.
Example Usage and Dummy Input:
The code includes an example of how to use the modify_and_write_file function.
Creates a dummy input file for testing.
Line Number Example:
Demonstrates how to maintain state within a modification function using a list, in order to add line numbers.
Clearer comments and docstrings.
Handles newlines: The code now correctly preserves newline characters, ensuring that the output file has the same line structure as the input file.
More robust function design: The code is more modular and reusable
